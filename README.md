### 🧭 How I Think
> I believe tech should **solve**, not complicate.  
> I learn by **doing, failing**, and **fixing** — in that order.  
> I ask *“what if?”* more than *“what’s next?”*

### 🔍 My Curious Mind

- How can I make this easier to understand?  
- What’s the most efficient way to do this?  
- Can this be done with less code?

> That’s the kind of thinking I enjoy.

### 💡 Not Just Code
> To me, code isn't just syntax — it’s how We shape ideas.  
> I’m more excited about **what a program means** than how many lines it has.
